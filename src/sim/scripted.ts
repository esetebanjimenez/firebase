/**
 * scripted.ts — waves written by hand rather than generated.
 *
 * The budget planner makes good generic waves, but it cannot teach. A lesson
 * needs a specific wave at a specific moment: the first time a player meets
 * something their current army genuinely cannot answer, with a name on it and
 * a sentence explaining what went wrong if they lose.
 *
 * Everything else about a scripted wave is normal — the same per-wave scaling,
 * the same spawn scheduling — so these are compositions, not special cases.
